1. Introduction:
Twitter has become an important communication tool nowadays.

The easy access to smartphones and internet enables people to spread emergency information in real-time. Because of this, more agencies are interested in programatically monitoring Twitter.

But, it’s not always clear whether a person’s words are actually announcing a disaster. Therefore, in this project, we will be building a machine learning model to predict which Tweets are about real disasters and which one’s aren’t.

The dataset is from kaggle natural language processing challenging(https://www.kaggle.com/c/nlp-getting-started).
